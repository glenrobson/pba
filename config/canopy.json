    "en": ["P B Abery was born in Folkestone, one of eleven children. In 1898 he bought a small photography business in Builth Wells and continued in business for half a century. By 1911 the business had grown sufficiently to allow him to move to the West End Studio. Darkrooms were placed in the basement, the shop on the ground floor, a workshop for framing and mounting on the first floor and the studio on the top to take advantage of daylight."]
